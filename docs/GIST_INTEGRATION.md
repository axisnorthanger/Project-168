# GIST Integration Hash Tracking

This document tracks imported gists and their latest SHA/hash references for the Project-168 system. It maintains a record of all external gist dependencies and their integration points within the project.

## Tracked Gists

| Gist Name | Gist URL | Latest SHA/Hash | Integrated Files/Section |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| PSL(2,7) Matrices | https://gist.github.com/axisnorthanger/b1f322cb | | |
| Rebalanced Tarot | https://gist.github.com/axisnorthanger/5480459b | | |

## Usage Instructions

1. When importing or updating a gist, record the latest SHA/hash in the table above
2. Update the "Integrated Files/Section" column to indicate where the gist content is used
3. Regularly verify that gist references are current and accessible
4. Use this tracking to maintain consistency across the project's external dependencies
