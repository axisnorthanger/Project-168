# Sequence: {☉⃝⚹⚹⚹♄☉⃝⚹⚹⚹♄}
# Pattern: Solar (☉⃝) - Triple Spirit (⚹⚹⚹) - Saturn (♄) - Solar (☉⃝) - Triple Spirit (⚹⚹⚹) - Saturn (♄)
# Unicode Character 'COMBINING ENCLOSING CIRCLE' (U+20DD)

The characters in your sequence, particularly the combining enclosing circle (⃝ - Unicode U+20DD), are outside this basic set. They are known as "astral" characters and often require specific handling.

  sequence_interpretation:
    primary_reading: |
      The conscious self (☉⃝) must channel divine inspiration (⚹⚹⚹) through material constraints (♄) in a cyclical process of creation. This is the pattern of all manifested works: Spirit becomes limited by Form, repeatedly.

    alchemical_process: "Solve et Coagula - Dissolution and Coagulation"
      phase_1: "Solar consciousness (☉⃝) dissolves into spiritual potential (⚹⚹⚹)"
      phase_2: "Spiritual potential coagulates into Saturnian form (♄)"
      phase_3: "The process repeats, refining the manifestation"

    magical_operation: "The Saturnine Mirror Ritual"
      purpose: "To manifest spiritual visions into tangible reality"
      steps:
        1: "Invoke solar consciousness (☉⃝)"
        2: "Channel triple spirit energy (⚹⚹⚹)"
        3: "Bind to Saturnian form (♄)"
        4: "Repeat to strengthen the manifestation"

  practical_applications:
    meditation_focus: "Visualize light (☉⃝) expanding into three directions (⚹⚹⚹) then crystallizing into geometric forms (♄)"
    ritual_timing: "Saturn hours during Solar days (Saturday/Sunday combinations)"
    material_correspondences:
      solar: "Gold ring, citrine, sunflower"
      spirit: "Clear quartz, mercury, mirrors"
      saturn: "Lead, black onyx, hourglass"
