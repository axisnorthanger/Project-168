# PROJECT-168 CONTEXT CARRYOVER
# This YAML summarizes the key architectural decisions made in the previous session.
# Use it to maintain continuity in the new chat.

session_achievements:
  - "Integrated Ars Paulina (Zodiac Angels) and Ars Almadel (Chorases) data from the Lemegeton into the project's data architecture."
  - "Defined clear CSV file placements within /data/raw/ and /data/processed/."
  - "Merged and resolved version conflicts between v3.2 and v4 of the Master Cheat Sheet, creating a unified v4.1 YAML spec."
  - "Established the Single Source of Truth (SSOT) principle for project configuration."
  - "Created and populated the definitive SSOT for the Heptarchic Cycle: /specs/heptarchic_cycle.yaml"
  - "Synchronized the Master Cheat Sheet to point to SSOT files, removing data duplication."

architectural_decisions:
  data_placement:
    lemegeton_raw: "/data/raw/lemegeton/"
    lemegeton_processed: "/data/processed/lemegeton/"
  spec_files:
    master_spec: "/specs/168-System_Master_Cheat_Sheet-v4.1.yaml"
    heptarchic_cycle_ssot: "/specs/heptarchic_cycle.yaml" # Contains full king definitions
  pattern: "Master Spec contains references & summaries; Detailed configs are in dedicated SSOT YAML files."

next_steps:
  immediate:
    - "Create and implement the Baligon Protocol SSOT file: /specs/baligon_protocol.yaml"
    - "Update the master spec to point to the new Baligon SSOT file."
    - "Finalize the 7 vs. 8 king decision for the Heptarchic Cycle (currently implemented as 8)."
  future:
    - "Ingest the parsed Lemegeton data (CSV files) into the application's runtime or database."
    - "Develop the astrological timer logic using the Zodiac Angels data."
    - "Build the ritual construction tool integrating Chorases, Zodiac Angels, and Force Kings."
